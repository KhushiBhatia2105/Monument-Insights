This project aims at predicting Indian monuments of Heritage Importance using techniques of Deep learning and is built using Python programming language.
The major libraries used are HTML and CSS for making the frontend design and Flask is used at the back end for serving requests regarding Prediction.

Once model training is complete then we can use  the web application for correct prediction of Monuments.
